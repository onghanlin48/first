                        Mobile Apps, with a specific focus in React andAndroid. Speed and efficiency are what I focus on
                        when creating a project. Itneeds to be simple, work properly, and get done in timely manor that
                        doesn'tbreak the bank. I have experience with other frameworks as well includingVue, PHP and
                        Flutter (experimental Android / iOS language). Most of myprevious projects have used Amazon Web
                        Services, Firebase or MongoDB. Ihave a special interest in creating databases and REST api's in
                        either MySQLor NoSQL. Feel free to contact with any questions to.</p>
